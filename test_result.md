#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS

# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:

# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.

#

# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state

# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

#

# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data.

# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

#

## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

## backend:

## - task: "Task name"

## implemented: true

## working: true # or false or "NA"

## file: "file_path.py"

## stuck_count: 0

## priority: "high" # or "medium" or "low"

## needs_retesting: false

## status_history:

## -working: true # or false or "NA"

## -agent: "main" # or "testing" or "user"

## -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_all: false

## test_priority: "high_first" # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"

##

## agent_communication:

## -agent: "main" # or "testing" or "user"

## -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent

#

# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:

# - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent

# - Add implementation details to the status_history

# - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing

# - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities

# - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done

#

# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:

# - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history

# - Update the working status based on user feedback

# - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count

# - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well

#

# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:

# - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md

# - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions

# - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list

# - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working

#

# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:

# - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:

# - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)

# - Any authentication details or configuration needed

# - Specific test scenarios to focus on

# - Any known issues or edge cases to verify

#

# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md

#

# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
